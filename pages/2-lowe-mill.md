Agents,

I'm relieved you made it. **Item B** in your *Agent Fieldbook* appears
to represent plans for a new urban development to be built in Moscow.
Each row and column contains exactly one building of each height,
either **one, two, three, or four stories tall**.
The numbers on the edges represent **skyline conditions**: the number
of buildings which can be seen from that position without being
obstructed by taller buildings.

TODO: need more info on how to get the codeword using environment
and the skyline puzzles.

**Photograph the TODO** for your records,
as well as **post a photograph of your team at this location to either
Twttr or FB** with the appropriate hashtags.

*Your mission continues at a golf course, but not the kind I usually
play at. Head to one of Huntsville's "Spring Parks", but not
the Big one.* Look for my mission update near the start of the course.

\- JEH
