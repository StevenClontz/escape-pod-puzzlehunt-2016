Agents,

I'm relieved you made it. **Puzzle B** in your *Agent Fieldbook* appears
to be a clever Soviet encryption, utilizing data which may be found
in this Lowe Mill mural. Our own spies have reported that you can
crack this code by following these instructions in order:

* Starting with the second letter, **shift every 2nd letter** by the
  **number of teeth** in the mural.
* Starting with the third letter, **shift every 3rd letter** by the
  **number of eyeballs** in the mural.
* Starting with the fifth letter, **shift every 5th letter** by the
  **number of letters** in the artist's name.

As an example, the letter **`J`** shifted by the number 7 is the letter **`Q`**,
since **`Q`** is seven letters later in the alphabet. Don't forget to
cycle back from **`Z`** to **`A`** when necessary!

Before moving on, be sure to **photograph the full mural** for your records!
You also must **photograph a teammate at this location for verification
purposes**.

*Your mission continues at a golf course, but not the kind I usually
play at. Head to one of Huntsville's "Spring Parks", but not
the Big one.* Look for my mission update behind a blue sign.

\- JEH
