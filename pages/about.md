### About the Game

Von Braun's Puzzlehunt was created by game designer and professor
[Steven Clontz](http://clontz.org) in partnership with
[Escape Pod](http://www.escapepodgame.com/). A puzzlehunt is a live adventure
game taking place across a city or other area: think The Da Vinci Code
crossed with puzzle video games like Myst.

The story behind this hunt was inspired by
[Von Braun's Office](http://escapepodgame.com/von-braun.html), Escape Pod's
first escape room. This puzzlehunt serves as a side-story: what if the Soviet
spies succeeded in infiltrating Dr. von Braun's office? Luckily, JEH has
organized a backup plan to capture the Soviet spies as they attempt to flee
the city: you!

Dr. Clontz ([@StevenXClontz](http://twitter.com/StevenXClontz))
was born and raised in Huntsville, AL, and his
[puzzles and games](http://clontz.org/puzzles/)
have been featured in various events and venues across the United States.
His work as a mathematics professor at the
[University of South Alabama](http://www.southalabama.edu) includes
cutting-edge research on game theory, and he also serves as director
of [Mathematical Puzzle Programs](http://mappmath.org) which aims to
get students excited about math and other STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics) fields by organizing puzzlehunts at college
campuses across the country.

Escape Pod ([@EscapePodGame](http://twitter.com/EscapePodGame)) is Huntsville's
premier escape room venue, featuring challenges perfect for your next
team-building event, not to mention the gamer or puzzle enthusiast in your life!
Anyone with an affinity for mystery and puzzles will enjoy spending sixty minutes
immersed in the enigmas contained in Von Braun's Office, the Spy's Lair,
or a Return to Wonderland.
