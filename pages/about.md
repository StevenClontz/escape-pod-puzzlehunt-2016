Von Braun's Puzzlehunt was created by game designer and professor
[Steven Clontz](http://clontz.org) in partnership with
[Escape Pod](http://www.escapepodgame.com/). A puzzlehunt is a live adventure
game taking place across a city or other area: think The Da Vinci Code
crossed with puzzle video games like Myst. During the hunt, players had to race
from location to location to gather the clues necessary for solving the five
[puzzles](/escape-pod-puzzlehunt-2016.pdf) before their opposing teams,
but we've added the needed information to each Mission Update so you can enjoy
these puzzles from the
comfort of your home. To play at home, download and print the
[game book](/escape-pod-puzzlehunt-2016.pdf) and read each Mission Update from
the [Von Braun's Puzzlehunt homepage](/). Can you name the identity of
the three Soviet spies?

The story behind this hunt was inspired by
[Von Braun's Office](http://escapepodgame.com/von-braun.html), Escape Pod's
first escape room. This puzzlehunt serves as a side-story: what if the Soviet
spies succeeded in infiltrating Dr. von Braun's office? Luckily, JEH has
organized a backup plan to capture the Soviet spies as they attempt to flee
the city: you!
