Agents,

Thank you for your quick response. Today's mission will take your
team across the City of Huntsville, so I hope you are prepared.
**Make sure you have a copy of the** *Agent Fieldbook*
**handy.**

Our other operatives are currently tracking down several suspects,
among whom are **three Soviet spies**. However, there's no way
we will be able to determine which of the suspects are guilty without
first deducing the **five Soviet codewords** which encode their
identities.

Our intelligence reports that **`ONAIR`** is the **first codeword**.
We also know that all the other codewords
are also five-letter words/names/phrases, but you'll need to decipher
**Puzzles A-D** in the *Fieldbook* to discover what they are, using information you'll
find around the City of Huntsville.

Your first clue is located not too far away.
*Head to a center dedicated to Dr. Werner von Braun, and find his
plaque in front of that building.* Remember, if you ever
feel like you're off the correct path, check for hints on the
[Twttr][Twitter] or [FB][Facebook] ARPAnet protocols using your
handheld computer.
