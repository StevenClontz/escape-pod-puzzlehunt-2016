Agents,

Thank you for your quick response. Today's mission will take your
team across the City of Huntsville, so I hope you are prepared.
**Make sure you have familiarized yourself with proper protocol by
reviewing the** *Agent Fieldbook* **if you haven't already.**

Our other operatives are currently tracking down several suspects,
among whom are **three Soviet spies**. However, there's no way
we will be able to determine which of the suspects are guilty without
first deducing the **five Soviet codewords** which encode their
identities.

We've discovered the first codeword: **`ONAIR`**. The other four codewords
are also five-letter words/names/phrases, but you'll need to decipher
the puzzles in **Items A-D** to discover what they are.

Your first clue is located not too far away.
*Head to a center dedicated to Dr. Werner von Braun, and find his
plaque in front of that building.* Remember, if you ever
feel like you're off the correct path, you can monitor the
[Twttr][Twitter] or [FB][Facebook] protocols on ARPAnet for hints.

Before you leave, **take a photograph of one of your agents at this
location and post it publicly to either Twttr or FB**. Don't forget
to include `#EscapePodHunt` and your team's tag so we can identify you.
