Agents,

Please refer to **Item A** in your *Agent Fieldbook*. What appears
to be a random grid of letters is actually a **Soviet encryption**.
The key to this encryption is the monument dedicated to Dr. von Braun
himself. It seems the number pairs below the letter grid are associated
with lines and words on the monument, although since English isn't the
Soviet spies' first language, they've **mixed up** the words a bit.
In any case, I promise that I will never
allow these Soviets to **cross** us again!

Make sure you **photograph the von Braun momument** for your records,
as well as **post a photograph of your team at this location to either
Twttr or FB** with the appropriate hashtags.

Remember, as long as you have a photograph of the von Braun monument on
your hand computer, you do not need to solve for the five-letter codeword in
Item A before moving on. However, you will need to solve most of the puzzles
before the end of today's mission if you hope to uncover the identities of the
Soviet spies.

*Despite its name, your next location is not particularly low,
nor does it currently grind or manufacture industrial products.*
Look for a mural on the exterior of its building with an aquatic creature on
its wall...
