Agents,

Please refer to **Puzzle A** in your *Agent Fieldbook*. What appears
to be a random grid of letters is actually a kind of **word search**.
The key to this puzzle is the monument dedicated to Dr. von Braun
himself. It seems the number pairs below the letter grid are associated
with lines and words on the monument,
although they've **scrambled** the words a bit.
Also, my sources suggest that it will be important to figure out why they
included the word **"cross"** on the page.

Make sure you **photograph the von Braun momument** for your records,
as well as **post a photograph of your team at this location to either
Twttr or FB** with the appropriate hashtags.

Remember, as long as you have a photograph of the von Braun monument on
your handheld computer, **you do not need to solve
Puzzle A before moving to your next Location**.
However, **NEVER solve and drive at the same time**! Let your passengers
puzzle things out while you transport them safely.

*Despite its name, your next location is not particularly low,
nor does it currently grind or manufacture industrial products.*
Look for a monstrous mural on an exterior wall to receive my next update.

\- JEH
