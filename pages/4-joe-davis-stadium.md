Agents,

It's great to be an American, and there are no Americans I respect
more than our **military**. When Joe Davis Stadium was operational, various
members of the military were given a discount.
Leave it to the Soviets to use this information against us!
Our sources say that to reveal the **final Soviet codeword**, you must
somehow criss-cross nine words related to military on the ticket booth sign
within the grid on **Item D**: ACTIVE through VETERANS.
Furthermore, you'll need to use a
well-known **tactile writing system** which replaces each letter
with a 2x3 grid of pips, AND you'll need to **rotate the grid** to write
some of the words. Devious... I suggest you start by writing
**VETERANS upside-down on the topmost row**.

Don't neglect to **photograph the ticket prices** for your records,
as well as **post a photograph of your team at this location to either
Twttr or FB** with the appropriate hashtags.

It's all about to come to a head. *Your final mission objective is
outside the building where
[Von Brauns' Office](http://escapepodgame.com) is located.* To solve the
final puzzle located there, you will need as many of the **five Soviet
codewords** as you can decipher, so get to solving!

\- JEH
