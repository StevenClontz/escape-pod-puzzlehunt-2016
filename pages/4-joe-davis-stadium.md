Agents,

It's great to be an American, and there are no Americans I respect
more than our **military**. When Joe Davis Stadium was operational, various
members of the military were given a discount.
Leave it to the Soviets to use this information against us!
Our sources say that to reveal the **final Soviet codeword** in
**Puzzle D**, you must somehow **criss-cross** the first nine words related to
military on the ticket booth sign: "ACTIVE" through "VETERANS".
Furthermore, you'll need to use a
well-known **tactile writing system** which replaces each letter
with a 2x3 grid of pips, AND you'll need to **rotate the grid** to write
some of the words. Devious...

Don't neglect to **photograph the ticket prices** for your records.

It's all about to come to a head. *Your final mission objective is
outside the building where
[Von Brauns' Office](http://escapepodgame.com) is located.* To solve the
final puzzle located there, you will need as many of the **five Soviet
codewords** as you can decipher, so get to solving!

\- JEH
