Agents,

When the stadium was operational, TODO something veterans.
Leave it to the Soviets to use this information against us!
TODO instructions for braille crisscross.

You should **photograph the ticket prices** for your records,
as well as **post a photograph of your team at this location to either
Twttr or FB** with the appropriate hashtags.

It's all about to come to a head. *Your final mission objective is
outside the building where
[Von Brauns' Office](http://escapepodgame.com) is located.* To solve the
final puzzle located there, you will need as many of the **five Soviet
codewords** as you can decipher, so get to solving!

\- JEH
