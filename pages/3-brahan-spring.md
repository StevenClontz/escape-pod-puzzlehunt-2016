Agents,

I'm afraid there's no time for a leisurely round of disc golf;
we need you to study a very different kind of game instead.
It seems that **Puzzle C** of the *Agent Fieldbook* represents
brackets for a **Hammer Plow Sickle** tournament between seven Soviet
operatives. We're not sure of the rules, except that it's very similar
to **Rock Paper Scissors**, and the rows of the below chart show how
each operative plays against the others:

<div class="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>1</th>

        <th>4</th>
        <th>5</th>
        <th>6</th>
        <th>7</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

Somehow they've used these tournament brackets along with the Brahan
Spring Disc Golf rules to encode a **Soviet codeword**.

Take care to **photograph the seven Disc Golf rules** for your records,
as well as **post a photograph of your team at this location to either
Twttr or FB** with the appropriate hashtags.

On the topic of sports, *I think it's time we moved position to the
former home of a true American pastime. The Stars may have moved on,
but that's not Joe's fault.* See you at will call.
