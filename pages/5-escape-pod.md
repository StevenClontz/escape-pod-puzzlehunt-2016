Agents,

The time has come to identify the **three Soviet spies**. We've
detained **sixteen suspects**:

<div class="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Abram</td>
        <td>Anton</td>
        <td>Artur</td>
        <td>Bagda</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Boris</td>
        <td>Denis</td>
        <td>Fedor</td>
        <td>Ignat</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Makar</td>
        <td>Motya</td>
        <td>Oskar</td>
        <td>Pavel</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pyotr</td>
        <td>Timur</td>
        <td>Yakov</td>
        <td>Yegor</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

To determine which three are the true spies, try writing the **five
Soviet codewords** in the grids printed on **Item E** in various orders.
Remember that I gave you the first codeword, **`ONAIR`**, in your Mission
Briefing; the other four codewords are hidden in **Items A-D**.

When you think you have determined the three correct names from the list
above, you may submit your accusation
[at this ARPAnet submission form](#). For security purposes, you will need the
**secret PIN** your team was assigned at registration, and you will be limited
to **only three total submissions**.

We will announce results over the [FB](#) and [Twttr](#) protocols, so
watch those channels after your submission to see if you were correct!
Thanks for your hard work, and good luck.

\- JEH
