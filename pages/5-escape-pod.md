Agents,

The time has come to identify the **three Soviet spies**. We've
detained **sixteen suspects**:

* Abram
* Anton
* Artur
* Bagda
* Boris
* Denis
* Fedor
* Ignat
* Makar
* Motya
* Oskar
* Pavel
* Pyotr
* Timur
* Yakov
* Yegor

To determine which three are the true spies, try writing the **five
Soviet codewords** in the grids printed on **Item E** in various orders.

When you think you have determined the three correct names from the list
above, you may submit your accusation
[at this ARPAnet submission form](#). For security purposes, you will need the
secret PIN your team was assigned at registration, and you will be limited
to only three total submissions.

We will announce results over the [FB](#) and [Twttr](#) protocols, so
watch those channels after your submission to see if you were correct!
Thanks for your hard work, and good luck.

\- JEH
