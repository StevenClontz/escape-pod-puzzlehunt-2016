Agents,

Welcome to **Von Braun's Office**.
The time has come to identify the **three Soviet spies**. We've
detained **sixteen suspects**:

<div class="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Abram</td>
        <td>Anton</td>
        <td>Artur</td>
        <td>Bagda</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Boris</td>
        <td>Denis</td>
        <td>Fedor</td>
        <td>Ignat</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Makar</td>
        <td>Motya</td>
        <td>Oskar</td>
        <td>Pavel</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pyotr</td>
        <td>Timur</td>
        <td>Yakov</td>
        <td>Yegor</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

To determine which three are the true spies, try writing the **five
Soviet codewords** on the grid rows printed on the **Metapuzzle**.
Once you've discovered the correct order for each grid,
**tilt your head right** slightly to make everything clear.
(Remember that I gave you the first codeword, **`ONAIR`**, in your Mission
Briefing; the other four codewords are hidden in **Puzzles A-D**.)

When you think you have determined the three correct names from the list
above, report the names of the three Soviet spies to one of my operatives
stationed at this location to complete your mission!

We will announce results over the [FB](#) and [Twttr](#) protocols, so
keep an eye on those channels!
Thanks for your hard work, and good luck.

\- JEH
