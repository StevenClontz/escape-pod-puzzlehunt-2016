Agents,

A unique situation has arisen in the Huntsville, Alabama area which
requires your services. Our intelligence reveals that **Soviet spies**
are converging on **Dr. Wernher von Braun's personal office** to obtain
secret documents vital to our national security.

We've already sent a team of agents to von Braun's office to find and extract
those classified documents before the Soviets can, but we cannot
guarantee their success. As such, **it's up to you to track down the Soviet
spies** as they attempt their escape, by following the clues
our operatives have uncovered around the City of Huntsville. You are our
last line of defense in this crucial national security mission,
and our fate lies in your hands!

To complete this mission, you first need to download the
[ClueKeeper app](https://cluekeeper.com/) from either the iOS App Store
or Google Play, and purchase **Von Braun's Puzzlehunt** via
the app or website. Your other requirement: obtain a
[printed copy of the Soviet puzzles](/escape-pod-puzzlehunt-2016.pdf)
which you will solve during your adventure. When you're ready, load up
the mission on your phone, head towards Downtown Huntsville, and good luck!

\- JEH

beta. To play without the
