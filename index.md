Agents,

A unique situation has arisen in the Huntsville, Alabama area which
requires your services. Our intelligence reveals that **Soviet spies**
are converging on **Dr. Wernher von Braun's personal office** to obtain
secret documents vital to our national security.

We've already sent a team of agents to von Braun's office to find and extract
those classified documents before the Soviets can, but we cannot
guarantee their success. As such, **it's up to you to track down the Soviet
spies** as they attempt their escape, by following the clues
our operatives have uncovered around the City of Huntsville. You are our
last line of defense in this crucial national security mission,
and our fate lies in your hands! Good luck, and I'll see you on
**Saturday, November 12**.

\- JEH
